        <p>When we first came here
            We were cold and we were clear
            With no colors on our skin
            We were light and paper thin</p>
            <p>And when we first came here
            We were cold and we were clear
            With no colors on our skin
            'Til we let the spectrum in</p>
            <p>Say my name
            And every color illuminates
            We are shining
            And we will never be afraid again</p>
            <p>Say my name
            As every color illuminates
            We are shining
            And we will never be afraid again</p>
            <p>Say my name
            As every color illuminates
            We are shining
            And we will never be afraid again</p>
            <p>And when we come for you
            We'll be dressed up all in blue
            With the ocean in our arms
            Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms</p>
            <p>And when it's time to pray
            We'll be dressed up all in grey
            With metal on our tongues
            And silver in our lungs</p>
